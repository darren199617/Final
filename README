Below is the exact same as the README file uploaded to moodle.

The application has been deployed at: https://firebassepro-e7b81.firebaseapp.com

Memory-Leaf.
I have uploaded all of the code. If there is a problem with the node modules because of the compression, you can download the project from GitHub.
To download the entire project go to https://github.com/darren199617/Final .
Download the file as a zip. When you save it navigate to the folder in the terminal. Once inside the “ionic-3” folder, Run the command “ionic serve —lab” to view the application on iOS and android. To view as website run “ionic serve”. 

______________________________________________________________
If you receive this error in the terminal,

[ERROR] ionic-app-scripts has unexpectedly closed (exit code 1).

Run the command “npm rebuild node-sass”

Now serve the application.

_______________________________________________________________

If you receive errors when in the browser when the application is served, open any .ts file in the pages folder in “sublime editor”[already installed on department computers].

Once the .ts file is open, just save it, “ctrl s” 

Example: 
open the pages folder, 
click on the “home” folder. 
Open home.ts in sublime. 
Save.

There should be a notification in the browser saying “building”,
The application should now run.
