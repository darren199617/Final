					When looking at numbers there is two different ways to try remember them.
					The first is to check if the number has something memorable.
					An example of theis would be: 19162000
					the above number could be broken up into two separate parts:</p>
				<p>
					<b>1916[Easter Rising], 2000[Millenium]</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>19162000</b>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p>
					Another way of remembering numbers is to break them up into smaller sections that may not normally be memorable. A phone number becomes far easier to learn once it has been divided.
					An example of this would be: 
					1800456987
					The above number would be easier to learn if broken into three sections:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>1800[1] 456[2] 987[3]</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>1800456987</b>	
				</p>
